Features:
- maybe s!s could be a sort of scanf
- maybe add “case” x I'y
- maybe use non-adverbial \ for some kind of statement (no ideas yet)

Tests:
- improve test coverage for error messages and refactor and improve them along
  the way (in particular, ensure more consistency) (in progress)

Documentation:
- maybe write some introductory guide (in addition to the current help and FAQ)

Optimizations:
- maybe special code for common arithmetic amends (like @[;;+;])
- maybe improve liveness analysis for code with branches
