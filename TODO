Features:
- maybe more capable io (like bidirectional pipes)
- maybe some kind of templating/interpolation
- maybe some kind of printf (though i$s and "prec" goal n do the job)
- maybe add splice
- maybe split i!s and maybe amend string @[s;I;s]
- maybe remove icount if #'= gets optimized to a single operation.

Tests:
- improve test coverage for error messages and refactor and improve them along
  the way (in particular, ensure more consistency)
- add more immutability tests to catch any possible regressions after the
  refcount overhaul, because refcounting is hard.
- add more tests for dicts
- search for location improvements in error messages

Documentation:
- write reference docs, or at least some some introductory guide (in addition
  to the current reference card)

Optimizations:
- maybe special code for remaining common op/ and op\ and op'
- maybe improve liveness analysis for code with branches, and for global
  variables
- maybe some remaining special cases in self-search functions
