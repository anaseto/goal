Features:
- more general io (open/read/write/close/defer?)
- maybe some kind of templating/interpolation
- maybe some kind of printf
- maybe add splice
- maybe split i$s and maybe amend string @[s;I;s]

Tests:
- improve test coverage for error messages and refactor and improve them along
  the way
- add more immutability tests to catch any possible regressions after the
  refcount overhaul, because refcounting is hard.
- add more tests for dicts
- search for locations improvements in error messages

Documentation:
- write reference docs, or at least some some introductory guide (in addition
  to the current help summary)

Optimizations:
- more special code for common op/ and op\
- maybe improve liveness analysis for code with branches, and for global
  variables
- maybe some remaining special cases in self-search functions
