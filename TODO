Features:
- maybe s!s could be a sort of scanf
- maybe add “case” x I'y
- maybe use non-adverbial \ for some kind of statement (no ideas yet)

Tests:
- improve test coverage for error messages and refactor and improve them along
  the way (in particular, ensure more consistency) (in progress)
- add more immutability tests to catch any possible regressions after the
  refcount overhaul, because refcounting is hard (in progress).
- see if there are remaining regressions from []bool -> []byte overhaul.

Documentation:
- maybe write some introductory guide (in addition to the current help and FAQ)
- write a summary of differences with ngn/k and maybe other K versions.

Optimizations:
- maybe special code for more uncommon op/ and op\ and op', as well as amend
- maybe improve liveness analysis for code with branches
- maybe some remaining special cases in self-search functions (all common uses
  already done)
