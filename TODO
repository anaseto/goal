Features:
- some kind of object/struct/dict thing
- more general io (open/read/write/close/defer?)
- split i$s, and cut x_s and maybe amend string @[s;I;s]
- more utf8 and unicode functions
- maybe some kind of templating/interpolation
- maybe add functions for handling text blobs of bytes
- maybe bitwise operations
- maybe a switch/match
- maybe add splice
- improve error locations for adverbs and some other special cases
- implement cycle detection in converge

Tests:
- improve test coverage for error messages and refactor and improve them along
  the way

Documentation:
- write reference docs and maybe some introductory guide (in addition to the
  current help summary)

Optimizations:
- more special code for common op/ and op\
- improve some special and general cases in self-search functions
- maybe improve liveness analysis (though simple, already good enough)
- many functions have deep Canonical calls in generic case when a shallow version would suffice
- refcounting of generic arrays is currently inefficient
