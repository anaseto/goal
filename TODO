Features:
- maybe add bidirectional pipes in open (though basic cases can be handled
  already with run)
- maybe some kind of printf (though i$s and "prec" goal n do the job)
- maybe add splice (never used it, though)
- maybe split i!s and maybe amend string @[s;I;s]
- maybe add a json reader (possible now that we have dicts)

Tests:
- improve test coverage for error messages and refactor and improve them along
  the way (in particular, ensure more consistency)
- add more immutability tests to catch any possible regressions after the
  refcount overhaul, because refcounting is hard.

Documentation:
- write some introductory guide (in addition to the current help)

Optimizations:
- maybe special code for remaining common op/ and op\ and op'
- maybe improve liveness analysis for code with branches, and for global
  variables
- maybe some remaining special cases in self-search functions
