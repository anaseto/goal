Features:
- maybe add a builtin for more convenient error handling

Tests:
- improve test coverage for error messages and refactor and improve them along
  the way (in particular, ensure more consistency)
- add more immutability tests to catch any possible regressions after the
  refcount overhaul, because refcounting is hard.

Documentation:
- maybe write some introductory guide (in addition to the current help)

Optimizations:
- maybe special code for remaining common op/ and op\ and op'
- maybe improve liveness analysis for code with branches, and for global
  variables
- maybe some remaining special cases in self-search functions
